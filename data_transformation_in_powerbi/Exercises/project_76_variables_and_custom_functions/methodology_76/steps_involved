1. Open the Advanced Editor and then add the following line of code right above the Source = ... code block:
FreshProducts = {"Seafood", "Meat/Poultry", "Produce", "Dairy Products"},
This stores a variable in your query called FreshProducts which contains a list of product categories that are considered fresh
2. Add the following block of code underneath the code you added previously:
	isFreshProduct = (input as list) =>
		let
			Result = if List.ContainsAny(input, FreshProducts) then true else false
		in
			Result,
This stores a local function called isFreshProduct inside your query that can be referenced in further steps in the query
3. Navigate to the Added IsFreshProduct step and delete everything in that step after the each and add the following: isFreshProduct({[CategoryName]})),
Make sure to include the curly braces and the comma at the end
4. Change the Calculated SafetyStock argument to obtain stock based on ReorderLevel with multiple of 3 for non-fresh Products, and then click Done
