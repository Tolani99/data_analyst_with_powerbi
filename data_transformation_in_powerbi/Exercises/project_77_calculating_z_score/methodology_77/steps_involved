1. Open the workbook 4_4_zscores.pbix from the Exercises folder 
   and open the power query
2. Head to advanced editor and change the aggregation method of the CategoryPriceStandardDeviation column to List.StandardDeviation() which is a non-standard grouping aggregation. Once you have made the change, click Done.
3. Expand the Grouped column, selecting "ProductID", "ProductName", "CategoryID", "UnitPrice", and "UnitsInStock".
4. Add a custom column named ProductPriceZscore which calculates the Z Score using the following formula: ([UnitPrice] - [CategoryAveragePrice])/[CategoryPriceStandardDeviation]
5. Add a conditional column called ProductPriceCategory which will categorize the products based on the ProductPriceZscore column you just created.
Use the following thresholds:
* If ProductPriceZscore is >= 2.5 then the product will be in the Gourmet category
* If ProductPriceZscore is between 1 and 2.5 then the product will be in the Premium category
* If ProductPriceZscore is between 0 and 1 then the product will be in the Standard category
* If productPriceZscore is < 0 then the product will be in the "Value" category
6. Group by the ProductPriceCategory you just created. Then add a sum aggregation called TotalStack where Column is "UnitsinStock"
