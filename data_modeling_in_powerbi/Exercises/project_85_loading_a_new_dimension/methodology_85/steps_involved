1. Import the file named Time.txt from the Datasets folder on the desktop
2. Go to the Model view and verify that there is a relationship between "Time" and "Establishment Survey" tables, defined by the Year column.
3. Return to the Report view and add a new slicer visual, slicing on Decade from the Time dimension
4. Adjust the size of the slicer in the page until you see the options and change the slicer to be a list of values rather than a range
