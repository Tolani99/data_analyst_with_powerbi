1. Go to the Report view and create a new page named "Comparison"
2. Create a line chart with the decade on the x-axis, the average number of employees on the y-axis, and the subsector(from the star dimension "industry") on the legend
3. Create another line chart with the decade on the x-axis, the average number of employees on the y-axis and the subsector(from the snowflake dimension "Subsector") on the legend
4. Change the title of the first line chart to "Star schema" Change the title of the second line chart to "Snowflake schema"
5. Open the Performance analyzer and start recording to begin performance analyzis, Refresh all visuals on the page. Do this several times to see f there is a consensus on whether the star or snowflakes schema is faster in this case.
6. Looks like there isn't a big difference in speed between both approaches for our relatively small dataset, dig a level deeper and go take a look at what the drivers of performance are for each visual.
